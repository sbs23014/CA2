While the merits of the project, as set out in the Business Case and Cost Effectiveness Analysis, are still as strong today as they were in 2019 we have been unable to convince the various State funding bodies, to support the project and provide part funding to supplement the Council’s own funding contribution.

       "     'selftext': 'Edit: I must address a reoccurring point. I thought I did in the early version of this but I shall excplicitly here.  Where is the evidence that people just want houses in Ireland? I would  be happy to read more into that but I can\\'t find anything to support this claim.  Unless someone wants to argue that the Irish are just \"different\" in this regard, I will copy paste something I copy  pasted from housing researcher Ronan Lyons\\' twitter account \" One-two  person households are already the majority of households in  Ireland  but, unlike in the rest of European cities, where 1-2 bed  apartments  make up 75% of housing, in Dublin they make up just 25%! \" People are  rent sharing those houses in Dublin, treating them like apartments but yet they just don\\'t want an apartment?  Google had to build their own one bed apartments because their employees  can\\'t find them on the market. They are in high demand, just poor supply.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirstly...WE DO NOT NEED MORE HOUSES!!! We have a massive oversupply of houses. So much so, they are being rent shared by strangers in crappy co-living-esque fashion! This does not happen in other countries where they have their shit together. We are short 400,000 apartments, not houses. Even as far as apartments are concerned, we have too many 3 beds and 4 beds, again being rent shared by strangers in co-livin.....you get the picture. We need more one bed and two beds. Why though?\\n\\nThe average household size has been plummeting. Why is this important? If the average household size is 4 and then it drops to 2, you need to double the housing stock just to keep housing prices stationary. We could decide to never build another house in Ireland again and never run short of them. That is how big this issue is. This is not discussed nearly as often as it should be. The demographics play a huge role in our housing issue. We need more housing units to meet current demand AND future demand as the population is growing alongside this shrinking of household units.\\n\\nOne of my parents was born in the 50\\'s. They were one of 14 children. This does not happen anymore! We need to downsize our supply and pump up the units. We need apartments and lots of them! Banning co-living is ridiculous when smaller housing is what we actually need and we have too many old school houses. Ban traditional houses instead if you insist on regulating the market. Traditional houses are effectively creating co-living scenarios without the toxic label you see all over the media. If you think co-living is the problem, you are seriously misreading the problem. They are a symptom of it. They are more like what people want than traditional houses. One-two person households are already the majority of households in Ireland but, unlike in the rest of European cities, where 1-2 bed apartments make up 75% of housing, in Dublin they make up just 25%!\\n\\nWhy are these apartments not being built when this is what we need? Why are so many office blocks and hotels going up when there is such high demand for housing? It is too expensive to build what we need! We have some of the highest residential building standards in the world! This is great for the living conditions (roughly speaking, ignoring rent sharing etc) But the end consumer will have to pay for that extra work the developer will do. You are not \"sticking it to man\" when he just passes it off in rents/sales price. You are sticking it to the middle class and working class. Very annoying for a student stuck living with his parents by the way! \"sure why are they building a hotel there? We already have enough of them.\" The developer does not care what you think the city needs. They can not make money off of what the city needs, so they won\\'t invest there. Help them make a profit and then we can get what we actually need. It is like Ireland in 70\\'s - 80\\'s. We were unattractive to invest in. We has mass emigration. We decided to make it easier to invest and make money here and now we have massively outstripped the UK in GDP per capita. Look that up! The UK has shrunk in GDP per capita and we have skyrocketed since the 70\\'s. We need to do the same with housing.\\n\\nRonan Lyons (an actual expert on this subject matter. He is the author of the quarterly daft.ie reports) points out an example about 10 years ago of a north American developer who saw our population going up and household size going down. Within these interesting demographics, they realised their was a good opportunity to build smaller apartments all over the shop and make a tonne of money. We effectively told them to fob off. Constructions costs, VAT, connection charges....too pricey, eating up profits. Not worth their while. They spent their money somewhere else. We could have had our housing supply issue fixed ten years ago. Alas, emigration and no disposable income for those who stay in Ireland is upon us instead. Before the pandemic we had a net outflow of people below 35. This is not sustainable. It is a crime what is happening to our population, particularly young people. We are failing our population and it is a choice to do so.\\n\\nLand Value tax could be brought in tomorrow morning and sort out the land market and land hoarding which is pushing up development costs which is passed on to the end consumer. Building regulations are great but ours have created some of the most high construction costs in the world. Soft costs are a huge issue also! Local authorities can dodge these, developers can\\'t. It isn\\'t like this is not paid! It is just paid out of taxes without appearing on the local authorities balance sheet. NOT HELPFUL! Developers pay billions to the Exchequer every year. Let\\'s not turn our noses up to private developers too much right? They are helping to pay for our hospitals, my SUSI grant and social welfare payment, and development of social housing. I am living in a social house so I am not too badly affected by the housing crisis other than not being able to move out of my parents house.\\n\\nShoddy, embarrassing access to finance  with the central bank lending regulations prevent most from evening looking at properties on the market. We need to loosen that up quickly. We have seen a net outflow of young people in this country because of  housing costs among other issues. Give them a reason to stay. Increase access to finance and reduce construction costs. Land value tax to stop  hoarding and tax poorly used land in ways other than hoarding. Effectively, we should tax opportunity costs. Golf courses taking up huge swathes of land in our capital is fine, if they want to keep paying for that \"improper usage.\" This is how we solve the housing crisis.\\n\\nAnybody who proposes government  building as a SERIOUS solution is probably deluded or looking for your vote. It  could be a small part but we need 35k units per year for decades to come to meet population growth and shrinking household sizes. We  need the private sector heavily involved to reach that. Therein lies the solution. The \"anti big greedy guy\" narrative is not very helpful if you actually care about the working class or middle class staying in the country and not leaving. Local authorities just sell off their social housing stock because they are some of the largest, weakest and worst funded in the entire EU! Look that up. You will begin to understand why we have big infrastructure problems and why local authorities are not building. They just sell off houses to create revenue for other projects even when they do, usually because the social housing was funded by central government. Totally not their fault when you starve them of resources. We have a long history of precisely this.\\n\\nWe need to do what we did in the 80\\'s attract foreign direct investment which lifted tonnes of people out of poverty, my family was one of them. This gave them a reason to stay instead of emigrating. Lets not turn our dumb noses up at anybody who demands a profit from investing in a business venture like real estate development. They are not going to work for free, hence where we are right now regarding housing supply and looking at hotels and offices springing up around our urban centres.\\n\\nEdit: I must address a reoccurring point. I thought I did in the early version of this but I shall explicitly here.  Where is the evidence that people just want houses in Ireland? I would  be happy to read more into that but I can\\'t find anything to support this claim.  Unless someone wants to argue that the Irish are just \"different\" in this regard, I will copy paste something I copy  pasted from housing researcher Ronan Lyons\\' twitter account \" One-two  person households are already the majority of households in  Ireland  but, unlike in the rest of European cities, where 1-2 bed  apartments  make up 75% of housing, in Dublin they make up just 25%! \" People are  rent sharing those houses in Dublin, treating them like apartments but yet they just don\\'t want an apartment?  Google had to build their own one bed apartments because their employees  can\\'t find them on the market. They are in high demand, just poor supply.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR, we need private sector development and lots of it. They are not delivering because they can\\'t make money due to sky high construction costs and soft costs that get passed on to the consumer who can not access the finance to cover such due to central bank lending regs anyway. This is why we have high vacancy in new developments and high demand for housing simultaneously. We need more apartments NOT HOUSES! Increase access to finance, reduce construction costs through building regs changes and LVT to stop regulating potential housing out of the market and stop kicking the crap out of everyone below 30!

They are in high demand, just poor supply.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly...WE DO NOT NEED MORE HOUSES!!! We have a massive oversupply of houses. So much so, they are being rent shared by strangers in crappy co-living-esque fashion! This does not happen in other countries where they have their shit together. We are short 400,000 apartments, not houses. Even as far as apartments are concerned, we have too many 3 beds and 4 beds, again being rent shared by strangers in co-livin.....you get the picture. We need more one bed and two beds. Why though?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The average household size has been plummeting. Why is this important? If the average household size is 4 and then it drops to 2, you need to double the housing stock just to keep housing prices stationary. We could decide to never build another house in Ireland again and never run short of them. That is how big this issue is. This is not discussed nearly as often as it should be. The demographics play a huge role in our housing issue. We need more housing units to meet current demand AND future demand as the population is growing alongside this shrinking of household units.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of my parents was born in the 50&amp;#39;s. They were one of 14 children. This does not happen anymore! We need to downsize our supply and pump up the units. We need apartments and lots of them! Banning co-living is ridiculous when smaller housing is what we actually need and we have too many old school houses. Ban traditional houses instead if you insist on regulating the market. Traditional houses are effectively creating co-living scenarios without the toxic label you see all over the media. If you think co-living is the problem, you are seriously misreading the problem. They are a symptom of it. They are more like what people want than traditional houses. One-two person households are already the majority of households in Ireland but, unlike in the rest of European cities, where 1-2 bed apartments make up 75% of housing, in Dublin they make up just 25%!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why are these apartments not being built when this is what we need? Why are so many office blocks and hotels going up when there is such high demand for housing? It is too expensive to build what we need! We have some of the highest residential building standards in the world! This is great for the living conditions (roughly speaking, ignoring rent sharing etc) But the end consumer will have to pay for that extra work the developer will do. You are not &amp;quot;sticking it to man&amp;quot; when he just passes it off in rents/sales price. You are sticking it to the middle class and working class. Very annoying for a student stuck living with his parents by the way! &amp;quot;sure why are they building a hotel there? We already have enough of them.&amp;quot; The developer does not care what you think the city needs. They can not make money off of what the city needs, so they won&amp;#39;t invest there. Help them make a profit and then we can get what we actually need. It is like Ireland in 70&amp;#39;s - 80&amp;#39;s. We were unattractive to invest in. We has mass emigration. We decided to make it easier to invest and make money here and now we have massively outstripped the UK in GDP per capita. Look that up! The UK has shrunk in GDP per capita and we have skyrocketed since the 70&amp;#39;s. We need to do the same with housing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ronan Lyons (an actual expert on this subject matter. He is the author of the quarterly daft.ie reports) points out an example about 10 years ago of a north American developer who saw our population going up and household size going down. Within these interesting demographics, they realised their was a good opportunity to build smaller apartments all over the shop and make a tonne of money. We effectively told them to fob off. Constructions costs, VAT, connection charges....too pricey, eating up profits. Not worth their while. They spent their money somewhere else. We could have had our housing supply issue fixed ten years ago. Alas, emigration and no disposable income for those who stay in Ireland is upon us instead. Before the pandemic we had a net outflow of people below 35. This is not sustainable. It is a crime what is happening to our population, particularly young people. We are failing our population and it is a choice to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Land Value tax could be brought in tomorrow morning and sort out the land market and land hoarding which is pushing up development costs which is passed on to the end consumer. Building regulations are great but ours have created some of the most high construction costs in the world. Soft costs are a huge issue also! Local authorities can dodge these, developers can&amp;#39;t. It isn&amp;#39;t like this is not paid! It is just paid out of taxes without appearing on the local authorities balance sheet. NOT HELPFUL! Developers pay billions to the Exchequer every year. Let&amp;#39;s not turn our noses up to private developers too much right? They are helping to pay for our hospitals, my SUSI grant and social welfare payment, and development of social housing. I am living in a social house so I am not too badly affected by the housing crisis other than not being able to move out of my parents house.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shoddy, embarrassing access to finance  with the central bank lending regulations prevent most from evening looking at properties on the market. We need to loosen that up quickly. We have seen a net outflow of young people in this country because of  housing costs among other issues. Give them a reason to stay. Increase access to finance and reduce construction costs. Land value tax to stop  hoarding and tax poorly used land in ways other than hoarding. Effectively, we should tax opportunity costs. Golf courses taking up huge swathes of land in our capital is fine, if they want to keep paying for that &amp;quot;improper usage.&amp;quot; This is how we solve the housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anybody who proposes government  building as a SERIOUS solution is probably deluded or looking for your vote. It  could be a small part but we need 35k units per year for decades to come to meet population growth and shrinking household sizes. We  need the private sector heavily involved to reach that. Therein lies the solution. The &amp;quot;anti big greedy guy&amp;quot; narrative is not very helpful if you actually care about the working class or middle class staying in the country and not leaving. Local authorities just sell off their social housing stock because they are some of the largest, weakest and worst funded in the entire EU! Look that up. You will begin to understand why we have big infrastructure problems and why local authorities are not building. They just sell off houses to create revenue for other projects even when they do, usually because the social housing was funded by central government. Totally not their fault when you starve them of resources. We have a long history of precisely this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We need to do what we did in the 80&amp;#39;s attract foreign direct investment which lifted tonnes of people out of poverty, my family was one of them. This gave them a reason to stay instead of emigrating. Lets not turn our dumb noses up at anybody who demands a profit from investing in a business venture like real estate development. They are not going to work for free, hence where we are right now regarding housing supply and looking at hotels and offices springing up around our urban centres.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I must address a reoccurring point. I thought I did in the early version of this but I shall explicitly here.  Where is the evidence that people just want houses in Ireland? I would  be happy to read more into that but I can&amp;#39;t find anything to support this claim.  Unless someone wants to argue that the Irish are just &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; in this regard, I will copy paste something I copy  pasted from housing researcher Ronan Lyons&amp;#39; twitter account &amp;quot; One-two  person households are already the majority of households in  Ireland  but, unlike in the rest of European cities, where 1-2 bed  apartments  make up 75% of housing, in Dublin they make up just 25%! &amp;quot; People are  rent sharing those houses in Dublin, treating them like apartments but yet they just don&amp;#39;t want an apartment?  Google had to build their own one bed apartments because their employees  can&amp;#39;t find them on the market. They are in high demand, just poor supply.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR, we need private sector development and lots of it. They are not delivering because they can&amp;#39;t make money due to sky high construction costs and soft costs that get passed on to the consumer who can not access the finance to cover such due to central bank lending regs anyway. This is why we have high vacancy in new developments and high demand for housing simultaneously. We need more apartments NOT HOUSES! Increase access to finance, reduce construction costs through building regs changes and LVT to stop regulating potential housing out of the market and stop kicking the crap out of everyone below 30! Thanks for reading! I look forward to your comments and counter explanations below.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"What you’ll see below are Ireland focused extracts from a study on alternative contemporary economic measurements.  It is designed to measure how effectively and equitably an economy distributes surplus value to its citizens. It measures whether or not excess economic growth is redistributed in the form of wages and mitigated cost of living across healthcare, childcare, education and accommodation.\\n\\nThe belief is that 1) socio-economic performance is a more effective indicator of overall economic performance, as it is experienced by citizens of the country, than macro-economic indicators alone and 2) that increasing cost of living without commensurate increases to median income is an effective predictor of future economic instability.\\n\\n*\\\\*The research that follows has been compiled over the last 18 months and is drawn primarily from OECD data. This has been extracted from privately commissioned research. Original data sources are public but final rankings are not.*\\n\\n**Introduction**\\n\\nA successful economy is one that can maintain or increase the level of opportunity and socio-economic mobility for its citizenry as it grows. It effectively distributes the surplus created through productivity equitably across a society to ensure that all citizens have an opportunity to prosper as the country does. An economy that grows, (i.e. increases GDP per capita) but sees proportionate increases in cost of living and consequential decrease in socio-economic mobility is not successful.\\n\\nGDP (or some derivative of it) has been the principal measure of economic productivity in the post war period. We have used it to assess the relative success or failure of both systems and regimes. But the world has changed and so too must our economies and the way we assess them. GDP was designed to measure corporate productivity. A belief emerged that GDP could implicitly consider 1) the success of the economic regime, 2) the government who implemented it and 3) the contentment of the electorate that put them there. Implicitly, a strong economy would lead to more opportunity and mobility for the electorate and a higher level of satisfaction with government.\\n\\nThis was an elegant solution in a world where the salaries provided by corporations could be expected to ensure socioeconomic-mobility in the long term. That is no longer the case.\\n\\n**Alternative Measures**\\n\\nWe have constructed an alternative system of economic assessment that has three constituent parts:\\n\\n1. Economic performance as measured by a weighted combination of CPI, unemployment rate, general government fiscal balance as a % of GDP and GDP volume and annualised growth,\\n2. Cost of living as measured by childcare costs (net childcare costs for parents using childcare facilities), housing affordability (House price to rent ratio &amp; household housing cost burden as share of disposable income), education cost  (private expenditure on all educational institution per FTE student &amp; annual avg tuition fees for bachelors degree) and health costs (private health expenditure % of annual wage) and\\n3. Financial Standing as measured by Household net worth, household financial assets, household savings % of total household disposable income &amp; income of people over 65 as % of population)\\n\\nBy using these criteria we can quickly establish if a rising economy is also reducing relative cost of living and increasing household wealth. This would be the best case scenario. An economy that increased relative cost of living whilst also increasing household wealth might be acceptable to most people but would not be ideal. An economy that sees increasing cost of living and declining household wealth during a rising economy is catastrophic because people are becoming fundamentally poorer despite broader economic success. It indicates a major systemic fault with the economy itself. This is the case for Ireland.\\n\\n**Ireland**\\n\\nIn 2012, using these criteria Ireland scored as follows. (out of 36 OECD assessed countries)\\n\\n* Economic performance: 33/36 \\n* Cost of Living Performance: 18/36 \\n* Financial Standing performance: 20/36\\n\\nIn 2020,\\n\\n* Economic performance: 1/36 \\n* Cost of Living Performance: 28/36 \\n* Financial Standing performance: 29/36\\n\\nSo Ireland’s Economic performance using more traditional measures has improved significantly over that 8 year period. Unemployment declined from 15.48% to 5.9%. General government fiscal balance as a percentage of GDP has improved significantly from -8.33% to -5.02% on GDP growth of 5.9% Traditionally, this would have inferred that Ireland was in pretty healthy shape but we can see that both cost of living results and financial standing have disimproved meaning that life in Ireland is more expensive in 2020 and people are poorer.\\n\\nSpecifically, Ireland ranks 32 out of 36 for childcare costs (up from 33). Private spending on education (primary to post-secondary non-tertiary, % of GDP) has jumped by a factor of almost 18 from 0.185% to 3.31%. The annual average (or most common) Bachelor's tuition fees charged by tertiary public educational institutions to national students (2013/14) has jumped by 28.74%. Private health expenditure has remained constant but Ireland still ranks as 31/36 for private health costs in the OECD.\\n\\nIreland ranked number 1 in the OECD for housing affordability in 2012. Incomes were reasonably high and mortgages reasonably cheap. Ireland had fallen to 12th by 2020. House price to rent ratio (Index 2015=100) has swung from 75.4 in 2012 to 114.9 in 2020. Real house price indices, s.a. (Index 2015=100) has swung from 78.3 to 126.9 meaning You might think that this still seems too high and you would be correct because 1) these numbers don’t consider further real estate inflation through the covid period and 2) it’s based on national averages. Ireland’s significant economic dependency on Dublin means that the relatively low rental and property prices across rural Ireland (compared to Dublin salaries) make housing look more affordable than it actually is. (this is evinced by data showing that the median of the mortgage burden (principal repayment and interest payments) or rent burden (private market and subsidised rent) as a share of disposable income, in percent nationwide had actually reduced from 18.49% to 16% in 2020)\\n\\nIncreases in property value have improved financial standing generally.

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’ll see below are Ireland focused extracts from a study on alternative contemporary economic measurements.  It is designed to measure how effectively and equitably an economy distributes surplus value to its citizens. It measures whether or not excess economic growth is redistributed in the form of wages and mitigated cost of living across healthcare, childcare, education and accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The belief is that 1) socio-economic performance is a more effective indicator of overall economic performance, as it is experienced by citizens of the country, than macro-economic indicators alone and 2) that increasing cost of living without commensurate increases to median income is an effective predictor of future economic instability.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\\\&lt;/em&gt;The research that follows has been compiled over the last 18 months and is drawn primarily from OECD data. This has been extracted from privately commissioned research. Original data sources are public but final rankings are not.*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A successful economy is one that can maintain or increase the level of opportunity and socio-economic mobility for its citizenry as it grows. It effectively distributes the surplus created through productivity equitably across a society to ensure that all citizens have an opportunity to prosper as the country does. An economy that grows, (i.e. increases GDP per capita) but sees proportionate increases in cost of living and consequential decrease in socio-economic mobility is not successful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;GDP (or some derivative of it) has been the principal measure of economic productivity in the post war period. We have used it to assess the relative success or failure of both systems and regimes. But the world has changed and so too must our economies and the way we assess them. GDP was designed to measure corporate productivity. A belief emerged that GDP could implicitly consider 1) the success of the economic regime, 2) the government who implemented it and 3) the contentment of the electorate that put them there. Implicitly, a strong economy would lead to more opportunity and mobility for the electorate and a higher level of satisfaction with government.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was an elegant solution in a world where the salaries provided by corporations could be expected to ensure socioeconomic-mobility in the long term. That is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We have constructed an alternative system of economic assessment that has three constituent parts:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Economic performance as measured by a weighted combination of CPI, unemployment rate, general government fiscal balance as a % of GDP and GDP volume and annualised growth,&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Cost of living as measured by childcare costs (net childcare costs for parents using childcare facilities), housing affordability (House price to rent ratio &amp;amp; household housing cost burden as share of disposable income), education cost  (private expenditure on all educational institution per FTE student &amp;amp; annual avg tuition fees for bachelors degree) and health costs (private health expenditure % of annual wage) and&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Financial Standing as measured by Household net worth, household financial assets, household savings % of total household disposable income &amp;amp; income of people over 65 as % of population)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;By using these criteria we can quickly establish if a rising economy is also reducing relative cost of living and increasing household wealth. This would be the best case scenario. An economy that increased relative cost of living whilst also increasing household wealth might be acceptable to most people but would not be ideal. An economy that sees increasing cost of living and declining household wealth during a rising economy is catastrophic because people are becoming fundamentally poorer despite broader economic success. It indicates a major systemic fault with the economy itself. This is the case for Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In 2012, using these criteria Ireland scored as follows. (out of 36 OECD assessed countries)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Economic performance: 33/36 &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Cost of Living Performance: 18/36 &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Financial Standing performance: 20/36&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In 2020,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Economic performance: 1/36 &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Cost of Living Performance: 28/36 &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Financial Standing performance: 29/36&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So Ireland’s Economic performance using more traditional measures has improved significantly over that 8 year period. Unemployment declined from 15.48% to 5.9%. General government fiscal balance as a percentage of GDP has improved significantly from -8.33% to -5.02% on GDP growth of 5.9% Traditionally, this would have inferred that Ireland was in pretty healthy shape but we can see that both cost of living results and financial standing have disimproved meaning that life in Ireland is more expensive in 2020 and people are poorer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Ireland ranks 32 out of 36 for childcare costs (up from 33). Private spending on education (primary to post-secondary non-tertiary, % of GDP) has jumped by a factor of almost 18 from 0.185% to 3.31%. The annual average (or most common) Bachelor&amp;#39;s tuition fees charged by tertiary public educational institutions to national students (2013/14) has jumped by 28.74%. Private health expenditure has remained constant but Ireland still ranks as 31/36 for private health costs in the OECD.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ireland ranked number 1 in the OECD for housing affordability in 2012. Incomes were reasonably high and mortgages reasonably cheap. Ireland had fallen to 12th by 2020. House price to rent ratio (Index 2015=100) has swung from 75.4 in 2012 to 114.9 in 2020. Real house price indices, s.a. (Index 2015=100) has swung from 78.3 to 126.9 meaning You might think that this still seems too high and you would be correct because 1) these numbers don’t consider further real estate inflation through the covid period and 2) it’s based on national averages. Ireland’s significant economic dependency on Dublin means that the relatively low rental and property prices across rural Ireland (compared to Dublin salaries) make housing look more affordable than it actually is. (this is evinced by data showing that the median of the mortgage burden (principal repayment and interest payments) or rent burden (private market and subsidised rent) as a share of disposable income, in percent nationwide had actually reduced from 18.49% to 16% in 2020)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Increases in property value have improved financial standing generally. Household net worth and household financial standing, et pension wealth and income of older people have all remained reasonably consistent in the period 2012-2020 but other countries in the OECD have outperformed Ireland on all these measures resulting in Ireland’s ranking slipping from 20th in 2012 to 29 in 2020&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Things have clearly worsened since 2020 but it’s clear to see that despite Ireland’s macro-economic success the economy is not working efficiently for the citizens of the country. The economy that we have created is one that generates more jobs and more growth but ultimately makes us poorer and makes day to day life more expensive. It is evidently unsustainable.

       "     'selftext': \"From Michael Kennedy TD:\\n\\n28-Oct-2010\\n\\nA Chara \\n\\nI write to inform you of today’s great news that the multi-billion-euro Metro North project has been given the green light and go-ahead by An Bord Pleanála, which is fantastic news for employment, business and economic opportunities in North Dublin. \\n\\nYou will be aware that I have been continually fighting for the Metro North project throughout my political career and I am absolutely delighted with the decision taken by An Bord Pleanála. \\n\\nI have included just some of the main points in relation to An Bord Pleanála’s ruling on the Metro North project and I trust this information will be of interest to you. \\n\\n1.        The infrastructure project is described as the biggest in the history of the State and the ruling from An Bord Pleanála runs to 1,700 pages. \\n\\n2.        The board has given permission for an underground track from St Stephen's Green to north of Ballymun where it will cross the M50 on a flyover. \\n\\n3.        It will go underground at Dublin Airport stopping at a centralised transport hub before going overground again to Swords with some of the line on stilts due to the undulating landscape. \\n\\n4.        The board has eliminated two stops at Belinstown and Seatown and ordered the relocation of a depot and park-and-ride facility. \\n\\n5.        The proposed Seatown Stop is being omitted from the scheme because it is considered that the permitted stops serving Swords (at Fosterstown, Swords, and Estuary) provide an adequate level of service to the town without compromising the service levels of Metro North or future development of the town. \\n\\n6.        At the Swords Pavilions Stop, access to the Stop at ground level across the carriageways of the R132 will not be permitted and the proposed signalised pedestrian crossings of the R132 will be omitted also. Access to the Stop shall be via the proposed ‘metro plaza’ above the R132 linking both sides of the road to the median at an elevated level. \\n\\nAlternatively, pending delivery of the proposed elevated plaza, the Stop shall be served by pedestrian bridges linking to each side of the dual carriageway, subject to an application for an amendment to this Order. \\n\\nThe Stop will not come into operation until the elevated access is in place, and satisfactory arrangements are made for access to the Stop for any users of any proposed bus and car interchanges. This is being done in the interests of pedestrian safety and free flow of traffic on this busy dual carriageway. \\n\\n7.        It wants the park-and-ride facility and depot moved from Belinstown, which is north of Swords, because of the risk of flooding and to be re-located.\\n\\n8.        The overall 18km line has therefore been shortened by 2.3km. \\n\\n9.        The final plan for the underground section at Ballymun and the stop at O'Connell Street also need to be finalised. \\n\\n10.       Enabling works on underground utility lines is due to start next spring, while the construction itself is scheduled to last from 2012 to 2016. \\n\\n11.       The overall estimated cost has varied from €5bn at the height of the boom to €3bn now with reduced construction costs. \\n\\n12.       The Railway Procurement Agency, in coming months, will have to make a final decision once the contract price has been received from the two consortiums Celtic Metro Group and Metro Express. \\n\\n13.        A number of economic studies have been carried out by the Railway Procurement Agency with the latest showing that for every €1 spent on the Metro there will be €2 back in terms of overall economic benefit. \\n\\n14.        The RPA says the line will be able to carry 20,000 passengers an hour with 10km underground providing a journey time of 20 minutes from Dublin Airport to the city centre. \\n\\n15.        Final approval from the Government on a cost benefit analysis will be made next year once the final tender construction price is advised by the Railway Procurement Agency.\\n\\nIf you require further information on this or any other issues, please do not hesitate to contact me by filling out the section below and return. If you would like me to send this to other parties please send me their email, fax or mailing addresses. \\n\\nYours Sincerely, \\n\\n__________________ \\nMichael Kennedy TD \",\n",

Here’s my few pence:\\n- while the stats might show that in 2012 we were doing much better, absolutely no one who lived through it would want to go back to that. My memories of the time were pay cuts, tax increases and emigration. \\n\\n- emigration was our safety valve for the last crash. It helped nearly every stat. As our economy recovered the young people returned and others also started to move here. The cso stats from last week have confirmed that our services (and housing) are under pressure due to huge population growth. How do you separate the problems caused by population growth from the economic growth? Is the population growth a short term issue that will ease and allow us to enjoy the benefits of economic growth? \\n\\n- our progressive taxation system is also partially responsible for our poor services. High earners pay taxes compatible with other European countries, whereas low earners pay way way less. We use the corporation tax receipts to compensate for their low levels of taxation. If we taxed them properly we would have money to pay for better services. Right now the people who do pay lots of taxes have very little interest in paying more for better services as they have to pay for some of those services directly themselves.

That feels like one added in to make Ireland do bad. If the average house price was €500 and average rent was €50 a month, you’d still do terrible, even though obviously the cost of housing would be very low. It’s an important metric for other reasons, but I don’t see how it really measures cost of living? A  very large proportion of the population own homes, so for them, the metric has no bearing whatsoever (in fact, it may be positive). Housing costs as proportion of earnings seems more reasonable.\\n\\n- some metrics such as education cost do not appear to be adjusted for earnings, while others are.\\n\\n- any metrics that are based off GDP will give meaningless results for Ireland.\\n\\n- the housing affordability one is interesting.

Private spending on education (primary to post-secondary non-tertiary, % of GDP) has jumped by a factor of almost 18 from 0.185% to 3.31%. The annual average (or most common) Bachelor\\'s tuition fees charged by tertiary public educational institutions to national students (2013/14) has jumped by 28.74%. Private health expenditure has remained constant but Ireland still ranks as 31/36 for private health costs in the OECD.\\n\\nIn terms of increased spending on private education, all this actually proves is that more people had enough money to spend on private education. \\n\\nIncreased spend on tertiary education is in lieu of tax increases. \\n\\n&gt;Ireland ranked number 1 in the OECD for housing affordability in 2012. Incomes were reasonably high and mortgages reasonably cheap. Ireland had fallen to 12th by 2020. House price to rent ratio (Index 2015=100) has swung from 75.4 in 2012 to 114.9 in 2020. Real house price indices, s.a. (Index 2015=100) has swung from 78.3 to 126.9 meaning You might think that this still seems too high and you would be correct because 1) these numbers don’t consider further real estate inflation through the covid period and 2) it’s based on national averages. Ireland’s significant economic dependency on Dublin means that the relatively low rental and property prices across rural Ireland (compared to Dublin salaries) make housing look more affordable than it actually is. (this is evinced by data showing that the median of the mortgage burden (principal repayment and interest payments) or rent burden (private market and subsidised rent) as a share of disposable income, in percent nationwide had actually reduced from 18.49% to 16% in 2020)\\n\\nCan you think of any reasons housing in Ireland was cheap in 2012? \\n\\nI\\'ll give you a clue, the unemployment rate was 15%.\\n\\n&gt;Things have clearly worsened since 2020 but it’s clear to see that despite Ireland’s macro-economic success the economy is not working efficiently for the citizens of the country. The economy that we have created is one that generates more jobs and more growth but ultimately makes us poorer and makes day to day life more expensive. It is evidently unsustainable. An economy that provides jobs but takes away wealth for the majority is one that is highly likely to experience considerable instability.\\n\\nTo claim the economy was \"more efficiently working\" in 2012 is actually pretty offensive.
